# DEC-Facile
 DEC Facile is a tool specifically designed for the creation of computational Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionaries (ECDs).


The backend is powered by LexO-server, an open-source RESTful API layer based on the GraphDB semantic repository and compliant with the OpenAPI specification (https://github.com/andreabellandi/LexO-backend) 

At the frontend level, the graphical user interface (GUI) provides a browser-based environment, implemented with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (https://github.com/Abdoumasbah/DEC-Facile-FE)
